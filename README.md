# Analysis-of-Air-Traffic-Control-Pre-Departure-Delays
Dnalysed European Air Traffic Control (ATC) pre-departure delay data from 2017 to 2023 to identify temporal trends, airport-level performance, and the impact of COVID-19 on delay behaviour. The project explores variations in delay patterns across years and highlights airports with consistently high delay levels using data-driven analysis.
