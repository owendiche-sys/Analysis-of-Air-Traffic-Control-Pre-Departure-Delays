**ATC Delay Analysis (2017–2023)**

**Project Overview**



This project analyses Air Traffic Control (ATC) pre-departure delays across European airports using data from 2017 to 2023. The aim is to examine long-term trends, identify airports with consistently high delays, and evaluate how the COVID-19 pandemic impacted departure delay behaviour.



The analysis focuses on understanding temporal patterns in ATC delays and providing data-driven insights into air traffic performance over time.





**Dataset Description**

Data Source



ANS Performance Repository



European air traffic and airport performance data



Key Features



* Year (2017–2023)
* Airport
* ATC Pre-Departure Delay
* Delay duration
* Operational performance metrics



Each record represents aggregated delay performance data for airports across Europe.



**Objectives**



* Analyse long-term trends in ATC pre-departure delays
* Investigate how COVID-19 affected delay behaviour
* Identify airports with consistently high delays
* Compare pre- and post-pandemic delay patterns
* Visualise changes in delay distributions over time



**Tools \& Technologies**



* Python
* Pandas – data cleaning \& manipulation
* NumPy – numerical analysis
* Matplotlib / Seaborn – visualisation





&nbsp;**Key Analysis Performed**

* Data cleaning and preprocessing
* Time-series trend analysis (2017–2023)
* Year-on-year delay comparison
* COVID-19 impact analysis
* Airport-level delay comparison
* Visual exploration of delay distributions



**Key Insights**



* Significant variation in ATC delays across years
* Clear impact of COVID-19 on delay behaviour
* Some airports show persistent high delay levels
* Post-pandemic recovery shows changing operational patterns
